 764782]","So sick and tired of the pouring rain
I took a train to Morocco just to kill the pain
Oh it might help a little, it might help a lot
I don't know, but it's all I got
Ran down the aisle to find a window by the bar
I blew a cigarette to pieces so I lit up a cigar
Oh this might hurt a little, this might hurt a lot
I don't know, but it's all I got

Oh, Morocco
Tell me where you've been
Won't you tell me what you know
Oh, Morocco
Tell me where you've been
Won't you tell me what you know

Crossing the desert when I lost the caravan
I found a compass in a box buried underneath the sand
Oh it might help a little, it might help a lot
I don't know, but it's all I've got
Running in circles I was losing my mind
When you found me and you led me to the water just in time
Oh this might hurt a little, this might hurt a lot
I don't know, but it's all I got

So sick and tired of the pouring rain
I took a train to Morocco just to kill the pain
Oh it might help a little, it might help a lot
I don't know, but it's all I got

It's Saturday and I won't be long

'Til I hit the dance floor, hit the dance floor
I got all I need
No, I ain't got cash, I ain't got cash
But I got you, baby

Baby, I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight
(I love cheap thrills)
Baby, I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight
(I love cheap thrills)
But I don't need no money
As long as I can feel the beat
I don't need no money
As long as I keep dancing

I don't need no money
As long as I can feel the beat
I don't need no money
As long as I keep dancing (Oh, oh, oh)

Baby, I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight

Baby, I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight (Oh)

You know what?
I like the playettes
No diggity, no doubt, uh
Play on, playette
Play on, playette
Yo, Dre, drop the verse

It's going down, fade to Blackstreet
The homies got at me, collab' creations bump like acne
No doubt, I put it down, never slouch
As long as my credit can vouch, a dog couldn't catch me **** out
Tell me who can stop when Dre makin' moves
Attracting honeys like a magnet
Giving 'em eargasms with my mellow accent
Still moving this flavor
With the homies Blackstreet and Teddy
The original rump shakers
Shorty get down, good Lord
Baby got 'em open all over town
Strictly biz, she don't play around
Cover much grounds, got game by the pound
Getting paid is her forte
Each and every day, true player way
I can't get her out of my mind (Wow)
I think about the girl all the time (Wow-wow)
East side to the west side
Pushin' phat rides, it's no surprise
She got tricks in the stash, stacking up the cash
Fast when it comes to the gas
By no means average
She's on when she's got to have it
Baby, you're a perfect ten, I wanna get in
Can I get down so I can win?

Baby never act wild
Very low-key on the profile
Catchin' feelings is a no
Let me tell you how it goes
Herb's the word, spin's the verb
Lovers, it curves, so freak what you heard
Rollin' with the phatness
You don't even know what the half is
You've got to pay to play
Just for shorty bang-bang to look your way
I like the way you work it
Trump tight all day, every day
You're blowing my mind, maybe in time

Flyin' first class from New York City to Blackstreet
What you know about me? Not a **** thing
Cartier wooden frames sported by my shorty
As for me, icy gleaming pinkie diamond ring
We bes the baddest clique up on the scene
Ain't you getting bored with these fake-**** broads?
I shows and proves, no doubt, I been diggin' you so
Please excuse if I come across rude, that's just me
And that's how a playette's got to be
Stay kickin' game with a capital G
Ask the peoples on my block, I'm as real as can be
Word is bond, faking moves never been my thing
So, Teddy, pass the word to your **** Chauncy

But you's a hell of a distraction when you shake your behind
I got J.O. up on my right side pourin' some cups
My whole hood is to my left and they ain't givin a fuck
So feel free to get loose and get carried away
So by tomorrow you forgot what you were saying today
But don't forget about this feeling that I am making you get
And all the calories you burn from me making you sweat
The mile-high points you earn when we taking my jet
And how everywhere you turn I'll be making you wet cause you can

The way she fit in them blue jeans, she don't need no belt
But I can turn them inside out, I don't need no help

Make you wish that you were sleepin' in my shirt
Lie about my jacket and tell everyone it's yours
When your phone rings after midnight and you're thinkin' maybe it's me
I'm gonna make you miss me

You're cold and hot
You burn out like a match
Keep the slip knot in the strings you attach

Girl, I'm gonna make you miss me
Make you wish that you were sleepin' in my shirt
Lie about my jacket and tell everyone it's yours
When your phone rings after midnight and you're thinkin' maybe it's me
I'm gonna make you miss me (Yeah)

Woah, woah
Woah, woah
I ain't gonna be that easy to leave
Woah, woah
Woah, woah
Girl, I'm gonna make you miss me

Writing letters that you're never gonna mail
Stay up and paint my favorite shade of red on your nails
'Cause you can't fall asleep and you're wishin' you were with me
I'm gonna make you miss me
Make you miss me
Make you miss the way my hand fit in your hand
When you're dialin' my number, listening to my favorite bands
I'll say, ""Hey baby, you know you can stay, just come and get me""
I'm gonna make you miss me (Miss me)
I'm gonna make you miss me
Woah, oh-oh-oh
I'm gonna make you miss me19Embed
You hear a new song, and it's your favorite
But pretty soon you'll be changin' the station
And all your old shoes are lookin' brand new
They wanna be worn but they never get the chance to
Heavy into everything, ready for the next thing
To catch your eye for a while, then you're over it
You change your mind on it
Soon as the shine's gone
Like you always do, but you don't know it yet, but

Woah, woah
Woah, woah
I ain't gonna be that easy to leave
Woah, woah
Woah, woah

Girl, I'm gonna make you miss me
Make you wish that you were sleepin' in my shirt
Lie about my jacket and tell everyone it's yours
When your phone rings after midnight and you're thinkin' maybe it's me
I'm gonna make you miss me

You're cold and hot
You burn out like a match
Keep the slip knot in the strings you attach
You think it's easy, but that's a lie
The only reason that you're good at goodbye is
Every boy you ever met, was too easy to forget
Well, I ain't goin' out like that

Woah, woah
Woah, woah
I ain't gonna be that easy to leave
Woah, woah
Woah, woah

Girl, I'm gonna make you miss me

I'd be at some party, she'd show up and I'd be walkin' out
Or across some parking lot, hidin' behind her sister
I'd look up, and she'd be at the red light beside me
In that white Maxima with the sticker on the back
I'd act like I didn't see her
We'd pay at the same pumps
Flip through the same stations
And slow down for the same curves
Run around with the same crowds
We just needed some time
She could get on with her life and I'd get on with mine
Thought I would be fine, heh, but maybe not
I knew she'd find a way to get over me
But I'd never thought

She would get down with somebody I know
I guess that's just how it goes when you break up in a small town
I see our friends and they put on a show
Like they don't want me to know
So they give me the go-around
But there's only so many streets, so many lights
I swear it's like I can't even leave my house
I should've known all along
You gotta move or move on
When you break up in a small town
See Sam Hunt LiveGet tickets as low as $81You might also like
For a while I guess they were keeping it low-key
But now it's like these county lines, closin' in on me
I see 'em everywhere together
And it's hittin' a little too close to home
She's so far gone, but she didn't go far
She was over me before the grass grew back where she used to park her car
She's leaving those same marks in someone else's yard
In someone else's arms, right down the road
And I never thought

She would get down with somebody I know

I see our friends and they put on a show

But there's only so many streets, so many lights
I swear it's like I can't even leave my house
I should've known all along
You gotta move or move on
When you break up in a small town

Her mailbox is seven minutes from mine
And I drive into town, sometimes and I see you sittin' there with him
And I wanna jump out, I wanna fight
I wanna say, ""**** that guy"" but I can't
It's my fault, I let her go

Folks know I'm country, when they hear
The way I talk

It sounds a little bit like my daddy
It don't cuss around my mama
Got some words you've never heard
'Less you come from down yonder

No, I can't hide it
I don't fight it, I just roll with it
Oh, kinda slow like the Mississippi roads
It's the only way I know

I just live the way I talk

Got talked into goin' out with hopes you were stayin' in
I was feelin' like myself for the first time in a long time
Until I bumped into some of your friends over there talkin' to mine

Then you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby, without warning
I was doin' alright but just your sight
Had my heart stormin’
The moon went hidin’, stars quit shinin’
Rain' was drivin’, thunder, lightnin'
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane

Knew it was gonna be a long night
From the moment when
We locked eyes over whiskey on ice
Started talkin' 'bout us again
If I woulda just laid my drink down
And walked out
I wouldn't be in my truck
Driving us to your house

Here we go

I'm a real bad liar, I'm a burnt toast kinda guy
And if I try to build a fire I'll burn the woods
I ain't a mover or a shaker, can't keep up with the pacer
Never met a dancefloor that ever did me any good

I can't change the world, no I can't change a flat
If you give me your heart, girl, well, you may never get it back
You said you'd never smile again, but oh no, here it comes
Would you look at that?
I finally found somethin' I'm good at

I got a poor sense of direction, sometimes too strong of affection
For a whiskey made in Lynchburg, Tennessee (That's right)
If there's a hole in my boat son, you bet that's all she wrote
I'm a Titanic sinking down into that deep blue sea

I can't change the world, no I can't change a flat

You're the author of the book
That I'm reading (Ain't ya baby?)
You're the moon, you're the sky
You're the apple of my eye
Make me laugh 'til I cry
Till I think I'm gonna die
Turn me upside down
Spin me around
Spend all my money on you all over this town

I can't change the world, no I can't change a flat
If you give me your heart, girl, well, you may never get it back
You said you'd never smile again, but oh no, here it comes
Would you look at that? (Would you look at that?)
I finally found somethin' I'm really good at
You thought it was over?
Oh my mine
I'm such a lucky guy
You got me tongue tied
Like Jekyll and Hyde
I'm coming undone
I'm born to run
I got my shades on
Here comes the sun
All cotton pickin'
My tick tocks tickin'
I love I'm stricken'
I'm flip flop flippin'
I'm 'bout to cuss
Son of a bus
I can't stop singin'
I'm havin' way too much fun

Whisper dirty secrets while I'm pulling on your hair
Poison in our veins but we don't even care
Candles drippin' on your body, baby, this ain't truth or dare
Everybody wonders where we've run off to
My body on your body, baby, stickin' like some glue
Naughty, let's get naughty, girl, it's only one or two
The fever's fuckin' runnin', feel the heat between us too

I'm gon' ride, I'm gon' ride
I'm gon ride, I'm, I'm gon' ride
On you baby, on you lady all night, all night
I'm gon' take care of your body
I'll be gentle don't you scream
It's getting hotter, make it softer
Feel your chest on top of me
I'm gon' ride, I'm gon' ride
I'm gon ride, I'm I'm gon' ride

Kiss your body from the tip-top
All the way down to your feet

I was runnin' from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I

Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way
Drivin' at ninety down those country lanes
Singin' to ""Tiny Dancer""
And I miss the way you make me feel and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Runnin' from the law through the backfields and gettin' drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when

We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh, how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home

We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill

One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
One's already on his second wife
One's just barely gettin' by
But these people raised me
And I can't wait to go home

And I'm on my way, I still remember
These old country lanes
When we did not know the answers

When I was six years old, I broke my leg
I was runnin' from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I

Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way

I wonder if Jack and Diane ever made it

Was the best they could do good enough?
Or did the heartland just swallow 'em up?
How did my mom and my dad ever do it?
If there was struggles, then we never knew it
I guess they had each other
That was enough

You know you can't keep the ground from shaking
No matter how hard you try
You can't keep the sunsets from fading
You gotta treat your life like you're jumping off a rope swing
Baby 'cause the whole thing's really just a shot in the dark
You gotta love like there's no such thing as a broken heart
You gotta love like there's no such thing as a broken heart

What am I gonna tell my kids when they see all of this bullshit that goes down on TV?
When the whole world is down on its luck

Cry when it hurts, laugh when it's funny
Chase after the dream, don't chase after the money

I know it's late but I knew you'd pick it up
Naw, I ain't drunk
Okay, maybe I do have a little buzz, but
That song came on and I just thought
What harm could come from one little call
I know you say you're taken but I say
Girl you're takin' too long

To tell him that it's over
Then bring it on over
Stringing him along any longer girl
Is just wasting precious time
Girl you know it can't wait
Rip it off just like a Band-Aid
The way you look at me, girl, you can't pretend
I know you ain't in love with him
Break up with him

I know you don't wanna break his heart
But that ain't no good reason to be
Keeping us apart
Look, just tell him it's you, it ain't him
And maybe you can lie to him and say you'll
Still be friends
Whatever you got to say to get through to him
That you ain't in love
C'mon you can't deny that you and I
Kinda fit like a glove
